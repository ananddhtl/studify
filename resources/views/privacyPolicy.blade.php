        </ul>
<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">We also share personal information about you with your consent or as otherwise disclosed at the time of data collection or sharing. </p>

<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">Applicants. Studify shares personal information about applicants with member Colleges and/or Universities to allow them to assess applicants’ suitability for admission, communicate with applicants, and meet institutional reporting requirements. Note that even if an applicant never submits an application through the Studify, the Colleges and/or Universities in which the applicant has indicated interest will still have access to the applicant’s personal information as part of the applicant’s pre-application data prior to the application being submitted. Such Colleges and/or Universities may use this information, for example, to contact applicants even prior to the time an application is submitted to provide information about their institutions and admission processes and deadlines. See "What are the applicant’s choices regarding collection, use and distribution of personal information, including your rights to ‘opt-in’ or ‘opt-out’," to find out more about how this works, and what information is shared and how you can limit such sharing. 
 </p>

<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">We may provide personal information about you to Partner Programs (all located in the AUSTRALIA), but only when you request that we do so. Find out more about our Partner Programs in the “Participation in Partner Programs” section of this Policy. </p>
<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">Subject to any rights afforded by law, Studify also reserves the right to disclose information collected from an applicant, when we have reason to believe that accessing and/or disclosing this information or taking such action is necessary to prevent, identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any of our on-line user agreements or policies or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Studify rights or property, other Studify users, members or Institutionss, or to help protect anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.
</p>
<p class="lead fw-bold">9. What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of information?

</p>
<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">Studify offers registrants a choice mechanism through which registrants can indicate whether they would like to receive communications from Studify and member Colleges and Universities. Studify also offers its App users the ability to provide choice regarding push notifications. </p>

<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">Applicants and Parents/Guardians. You will not be able to utilize our services unless you complete an on-line User Registration form. When you first register with Studify, you are given the option to choose to receive communications from member Colleges and Universities and have certain personal information released to our member Colleges and Universities on your "My Colleges List" prior to submission of your application to that selected member College or University. 
 </p>
<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">Should you "opt in," you can later change your mind and "opt out" for any member College or University by using the "Unsubscribe" link located at the bottom of the email you receive from that member College or University. Alternatively, you may "opt out" for all member Colleges and Universities by changing the setting located on your "Account Maintenance" page. You can access the “Account Maintenance” page by clicking on the Settings icon in the upper right hand corner of your application after logging in. </p>

<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">Should you choose to "opt in," a limited amount of the personal information that you provided us will be released to your designated member Colleges and Universities prior to submission of your application to those selected members. The personal information shared will include your name, permanent home address, ethnicity, sex, citizenship, date of birth, phone number(s), email address, and Social Security number. In addition, your "opting-in" will allow member Colleges and Universities to use your information to contact you at any time and/or to text you at your cell phone number.</p>
<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">Should you choose to "opt out," a more limited amount of personal information about you is released to your selected member Colleges and Universities to allow such Colleges and Universities to track the demographics of their prospective applicant pool as well as the ability to respond to inquiries from applicants who have indicated an interest in their institution. The personal information shared will include your name, city, state, zip code, country, sex, citizenship, and date of birth.</p>

<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">Once registered, while you are free not to provide any personal information requested on the Studify form, any application supplement or other applicant form, to do so may cause the member College and/or University that you select to reject the application, supplement or other applicant form as incomplete. This may delay the application admission process or result in a rejection of the submission regardless of payment. Users should communicate with their designated College and/or University directly if any admission application is delayed or rejected or otherwise results in an outcome that does not satisfy the applicant's expectations. The Studify is not involved in and cannot be held responsible for any admission outcome of any specific applicant.  </p>
<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">When you register with Studify, you are also required to express your communications preferences to receive communications from Studify. These communications may includeemails, phone or text messages or physical mailings to your address. These communications may go beyond the technical support of application submission to include information on financial aid, tips, and broader topics that Studify feels would benefit you. If you later decide that you would like to “opt out,” please contact the applicant Solutions Center with your request, using the “Instructions & Help” link from your applicant account, or by clicking on the gear icon from your applicant account and changing your communication preference. If you “opt out,” we may still contact you with messages regarding your account with us, including registration and submission confirmation texts, physical mail, and/or emails, to contact you to help answer a technical support question that you may have posed to us regarding your use of the Properties.</p>
<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">Through our App, we send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about the admission application process. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To send these notifications, we collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information. </p>
<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">Institutions Officials and Recommenders. If you “opt out” of the online recommendation system via the email invitation initiated by the applicant, you will not receive any College/University specific information concerning the applicant’s admissions process; however, we may use your email address, cell phone number, and/or mailing address to send you registration and submission confirmation communications, text messages or emails, or we may need to contact the user/recommender to help answer a technical support question that you may have posed to us regarding your use of the Properties and to provide you with other information relevant to the student’s admission application process. Additionally, any member colleges may communicate with you regarding the applicant, using the information you or the applicant provide. </p>
<p class="mb-sm-5 mb-grid-gutter">College/ University Administrators. Common App Member Colleges and Universities may register administrators via the Common App Member Portal. Those registered administrators will be able to access all member information in the member portal including, the membership Agreement, and applicable membership information. Member Colleges and Universities may change or remove any administrator at any time via the Member Portal.</p>


<p class="lead fw-bold">10. What is Studify's policy on retention and allowing you to access, update, correct, or delete your personal information?
</p>
